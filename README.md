nmea-parser
===========

pynmea2 is a good parser.  However, the output is not suitable for my use.
That's is why I make another parser here.

- nmea-stat.py is a tool.
- nmea_parser.py is a class to parse the NMEA message.

## BUGS

I have implemented only NMEA messages I need.
Other messages might be added in the future.
